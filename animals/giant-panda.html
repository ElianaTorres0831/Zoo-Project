                <h1>Giant Panda</h1>
                <p><strong>Giant pandas</strong> or simply known as <strong>pandas</strong> is a species of bears that are endemic to the country of China. Giant pandas mainly eat bamboo and leaves but very rarely will they eat meat in the form of small birds or rodents. The average lifespan of a giant panda is between 14 to 30 years of age. The giant panda is in the <strong>Ursidae</strong> family, which is the family most other bears are in. Unlike other bear species, the giant panda does not hibernate when the winter season arrives, and instead they just move down the mountains to warmer temperatures.</p>
