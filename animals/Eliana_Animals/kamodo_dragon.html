                The <strong>Komodo Dragon</strong>, also known as the "Varanus komodoensis", is the largest lizard in the world. 
                Its muscular body is covered in scales that vary in color for it to adapt and blend into its surroundings.
                Its tail is a counter balance to the rest of the body, aiding it in swift and harsher movements.
                Due to the nature of their skin color, komodo dragons use this advantage to ambush their pray with quick attacks.
