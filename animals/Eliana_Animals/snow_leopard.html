                The <strong>snow leopard</strong>, also known as "Panthera uncia" is native to Central and South Asia. 
                Its thick, gray fur allows it to adapt to its surroundings of high altitude and rocky terrain. 
                It protects them from the extreme colds of the mountains and allows it to camoflauge for hunting.
                Due to its agility and strength, they are the top of the food chain in the mountains of the animal kingdom.
                Fun fact: The snow leopard is my favorite animal!
