                <strong> Sea Lions </strong> are pinnipeds characterized by external ear flaps, long foreflippers, the ability to walk on all fours, short and thick hair, and a big chest and belly. 
                Together with the fur seals, they make up the family Otariidae, eared seals. 
                The sea lions have six extant and one extinct species (the Japanese sea lion) in five genera. 
                Their range extends from the subarctic to tropical waters of the global ocean in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with the notable exception of the northern Atlantic Ocean.
                They have an average lifespan of 20â€“30 years.
