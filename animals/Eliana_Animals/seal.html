                <strong> Sea Lions </strong> also known as Seals, are adapted to both ocean and land enviornments. 
                Their fur is sleek and water resistant, and can vary in color based off their species (ex. pale gray to brown).
                Their snout is whiskered in which aids them in navigation and hunting for food and their flippers help them in having quick speeds in the water and to be agile on land.
                Their calls are unique to their enviornments / species, from roars, to barking, and lastly wails.
