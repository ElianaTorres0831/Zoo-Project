                The <strong>North American River Otter</strong> is a semi - aquatic animal. 
                Its fur is sleek and water resistant, providing protection from the temperatures in the water and bouyancy to float.
                Their paws are webbed, so it helps them swim in fast rivers with precision.
                Fun fact: They cover their eyes when they want to sleep! (as shown in the picture above)
