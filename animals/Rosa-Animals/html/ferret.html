    <p> Ferrets are domesticated members of the Mustelidae family, which also includes weasels, otters, and badgers. 
      They're known for their playful and inquisitive nature. 
      These pint-sized predators are incredibly agile and have long, slender bodies built for burrowing and exploring. 
      What sets ferrets apart are their distinct markings, with a mask-like pattern on their faces and sleek fur that can come in various colors. Ferrets are social animals, which means they love to interact with humans and other ferrets. They have a natural curiosity and can get themselves into all sorts of playful mischief. It's important to provide them with mental stimulation and plenty of playtime to keep them happy and healthy.
      When it comes to diet, ferrets are obligate carnivores, which means they need a diet primarily based on meat, like high-quality ferret kibble or raw meat.
