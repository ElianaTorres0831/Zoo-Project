                <h1>Polar Bear</h1>
                <p>The <strong>polar bear</strong> is the largest species of bear in the world. They are also known as the largest land mammal carnivores on the planet and can grow up to eight feet tall. These bears are native to the Arctic and spend most of its life on the ice. Polar bears are known to hunt seals and arctic foxes as their food. The fur of the polar bear is not actually white, but instead is hollow and reflects light off it which is why it looks white. These bears spend so much time in the ocean looking for food that they are classified as marine mammals. Polar bears evolved from the brown bear to adapt to the harsh climate of the Arctic. </p>
