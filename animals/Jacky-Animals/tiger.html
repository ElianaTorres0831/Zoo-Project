                <h1>Tiger</h1>
                <p>The <strong>tiger</strong> is the largest living cat species in the world. Known as an apex predator, the tiger is known for hunting deer and antelope. Tigers are nocturnal hunters and generally hunt alone. Tigers have been around for more than 2 million years, but have become endangered due to humans. At top speeds, tigers can reach up to 65 kilometers per hour. Unlike most other members of the cat family, the tiger is known for liking water and are good swimmers. </p>
